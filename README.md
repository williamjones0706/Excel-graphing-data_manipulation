# Excel-graphing-data_manipulation

This repo contains a series of challenges solved using techniques and data manipulation in excel. The challenges range from graphing to regression analysis.

1. What better way to express moving averages than with a data set that is all about calculating the average accuracy of a golfer? We had 5 golfers take 20 shots onto a green and calculated the distance to the hole. It is up to you to find the moving averages of their shots using different intervals.

2. Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, you will pair up with one of your classmates in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

3. The task is to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets. Then create charts which compare the sales of publishers against one another.

4. Run a regression analysis on the 2017 NBA Season and explain the results.
